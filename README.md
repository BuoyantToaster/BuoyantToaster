Hi, Iâ€™m @BuoyantToaster
I am currently doing most of my programming on Arduinos and ESP32 Microcontrollers (all programmed via Arduino IDE in C). Usually these things I do in combination with other electronics projects I make. The most recent project being a Protogen head :3
I also do a lot in CAD design and 3d printing. My current goal is to learn Fusion360.
